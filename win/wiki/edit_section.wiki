=How to edit section=



1. { means sub body start

2. } means sub body end

3. # means comment, like \\ in C++

4. field define format as bellow:

              field_name: field_lenth: field_value

field_name dosen't mean's a lot here, only "section_length" and "length" are used for check if format length ok.
field_lenth is length in bit of this field.
field_value is value in hex format.


* note*: the total length inside {} must be correct, same as "length" field plus head length.
